# GFG-Insider
Basically it tells how many questions have you solved in percentage (Basic, Easy, Medium, Hard)

This project is a web application that allows a user to check their progress on GeeksforGeeks (GFG) by entering their username. It fetches the user's solved problem counts from an external source and then calculates and displays the percentage of problems solved for different difficulty levels (Basic, Easy, Medium, Hard), providing a visual overview of their progress.
